Playlist Project

This project is a modern web application built with the latest JavaScript tools and techniques. It allows users to:

Add songs dynamically to the playlist

Like songs to show preference

Remove the entire playlist when desired

The goal was to create a responsive and interactive user experience using up-to-date JavaScript features.
